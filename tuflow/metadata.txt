changelog=ARR2016 to TUFLOW tool updated to be compatible with updated ARR datahub
          Fixed NULL geometry bug when drawing cross sections and flux lines
          Fixed bug when water level PO points were not being displayed as result type
          Fixed bug when adding cross section plots to animations
          Better error checking when results are not in correct CRS and drawing graphic layers

          Fixed bug in ARR2016 to TUFLOW dialog when clicking 'User Area' for ARF
          Fixed bug when loading a Project with more than 1 open mesh layer - result types used to be duplicated
          Fixed bug when loading in map outputs after loading in time series results
          Fixed bug where tuflow viewer would not recognise map output result types if there was no temporal results but there was maximum results
          Fixed bug with time series result types not showing for all types e.g. 2D flow area
